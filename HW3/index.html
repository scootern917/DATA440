            <h2>SCAD, ElasticNet, and SqrtLasso Variable Selection & Implementation Using PyTorch</h2>
            <h4>Scooter Norton</h4>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>In this project, I wrote a class for Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD), tested it on the concrete dataset,
                and determined variable selection for the data using SCAD. I then generated random datasets with correated features,
                and compared SCAD's performance with that of ElasticNet and SqrtLasso based on a sparsity pattern (betastar) of my choosing.
                Finally, I used the methods on quadratic interaction terms for the concrete dataset. I was able to determine the best
                weights for the penalty function, assess ideal model size, and obtained MSEs through K-Fold cross-validation.
                <a href="https://github.com/scootern917/DATA440/blob/main/HW3/implementation.ipynb" target="_blank">Here</a> is the notebook
                where you can find my implementation.
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Part 1: SCAD for variable selection and regularization</h3>
            <p>The class I wrote for SCAD can be found <a href="https://github.com/scootern917/DATA440/blob/main/HW3/SCAD.py" target="_blank">here.</a>
                I loaded in the concrete dataset, scaled it, and used it to predict strength values for concrete. Based on those predictions, 
                I was able to determine the strong and weak predictors for strength by obtaining the coefficients for each feature. In this
                case, cement, slag, age, ash, and water were stronger for predicting strength, and superplastic, coarseagg, and fineagg were
                weak predictors. I then created a manual grid search model (my SCAD class was not scikit compliant) to find the best values
                for the SCAD hyperparameters lambda. The results can be found
                <a href="https://github.com/scootern917/DATA440/blob/main/HW3/lambda_vals_pt1.png" target="_blank">here.</a> Based on this,
                we can see that for the concrete dataset, it is best to use lambda <=1.5.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Part 2: Comparisons to ElasticNet and SqrtLasso using generated datasets with correlated features</h3>
            <p>In this portion of the project, in addition to the SCAD class, I implemented two new classes, 
                <a href="https://github.com/scootern917/DATA440/blob/main/HW3/OtherClasses.py" target="_blank">ElasticNet and SqrtLasso.</a>
                I used a provided function, make_corrrelated_features, to create 200 datasets with 8 features each, with the
                features having a correlation value of 0.9 (strong correlation). I then created a sparsity pattern (betastar) of my choosing,
                with the intent to see which model most closely resembles the initial betastar. To do this, I scored each model using MSEs to
                see overall accuracy, and then created a coefficient dataframe using those models. I then found the absolute deviation from
                the initial betastar by subtracting each betastar value from each coefficient provided by the models. I then graphed the results,
                which can be found <a href="https://github.com/scootern917/DATA440/blob/main/HW3/coeff_estimates_pt2.png" target="_blank">here.</a>
                From this, we can see that SCAD and SqrtLasso performed similarly, with ElasticNet lagging behind. SCAD was more accurate when
                the betastar value was non-zero, but was less accurate when betastar was zero.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Part 3: Determining weights, penalties, model size, and MSEs using SCAD</h3>
            <p>In this part of the project, I started by changing the feature values of the concrete dataset to be quadratic. I scaled the data
                and fitted it to tensors, before beginning my parameter search for lambda and a (SCAD hyperparams). After determining that the
                the hyperparameter values had little impact on the model's performance, I fitted the model using the strongest learning rate I
                found thorugh trial and error. I created a coefficient tensor to perform my K-Fold cross-validation. I then printed the scores
                and best number of coefficients for each split in the cross-validation process.
                <a href="https://github.com/scootern917/DATA440/blob/main/HW3/num_coeff_pt3.png" target="_blank">Here</a> are my results. From
                this, we can see that 44 coefficients yielded the best performing model for each split. This means that when using quadratic
                interaction terms on the concrete dataset, the best choice for variable selection using SCAD is 44 terms.
            </p>
