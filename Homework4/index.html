            <h3>Class Imbalance</h3>
            <p>Class imbalance occurs when there is a large difference in size between two classes. When there is class imbalance, the model
                may often have a strong bias towards the majority class. This can be seen in resulting confusion matrices; in a highly imbalanced
                data set, the model may overpredict the majority class, while neglecting the minority class. This is problematic in cases where
                false positives and false negatives can be harmful. To give one example, in a dataset comprised of cancer patients and non-cancer
                patients, a simple model that doesn't account for class imbalance may yield many false negatives; in this case, that would mean
                returning a negative result on a person who in fact has cancer. This is obviously not ideal, so there are several strategies used
                to address these problems.
            </p>
            <h3>SMOTE</h3>
            <p>Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (a.k.a. SMOTE), is a method that generates synthetic data for the minority class to
                compensate for a class imbalance. It first identifies the minority class, then uses k-nearest neighbors within the same class to 
                find the closest points in the space. It creates invisible line segments between nearby points of the same class, and then places 
                points along that line to introduce new, yet realistic, data points into the grid. Those points are generated and added to the 
                dataset until the minority class contains the same number of samples as the majority class.
            </p>
            
            <br>
            <p>Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (a.k.a. ADASYN) is similar to SMOTE in that it generates synthetic data for the minority class. However,
                instead of creating point in between neighboring minority class points, it calculates the proportion of majority class points that
                are k-nearest neighbors to a given minority class point. It creates a density value to assign weights; minority class points with
                more majority class neighbors are given greater weight. The greater the weight assigned to a point, the more points are created
                nearby. Therefore, sparser regions of minority class points generate more synthetic minority class points.

                FastKDE helps with ADASYN, as it is a kernel for density estimation. It generates a probability density function for each class in
                the space, allowing ADASYN to more accurately identify sparse areas in the space. The best time to use ADASYN with FastKDE is when
                the decision boundary for a dataset subject to class imbalance is complex.
